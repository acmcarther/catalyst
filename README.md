# Catalyst

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/acmcarther/catalyst.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/acmcarther/catalyst)

Catalyst is a small bot to automate your Github workflow. It's purpose is to take
care of the monotonous aspects of merging feature branches back into the main
development branch. This includes identifying peer reviewers, monitoring
continuous integration, and autmatically handling merging branches back in. It
also takes care of batching commits on your development branch into releases
to a production branch if you so choose.
